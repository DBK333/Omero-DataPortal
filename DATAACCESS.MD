# OMERO Access Control Management and Link Sharing

## Access Control Management with Root

OMERO provides a robust permission system that allows administrators to control user access to projects, datasets, and images. The full documentation on OMERO server permissions can be found here:

[OMERO Server Permissions](https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sysadmins/server-permissions.html)

### Steps to Manage Access Control:
1. **Create a New User with Suitable Permissions:**
   - Assign the appropriate roles and group memberships based on the required access level.
   - Set the group type: Private, Read-Only, or Read-Write.
   - Define specific permissions for datasets and images.

2. **Verify Permissions:**
   - Ensure the user has the correct access control settings by testing the login and checking data visibility.

## How to Get Links for Projects and Datasets

Once you have created a user with suitable permissions, you can share links to specific Projects, Datasets, or Images with other users.

### Steps to Copy URL Links:
1. **Navigate to the Desired Project, Dataset, or Image:**
   - Open the OMERO web interface.
   - Locate the specific Project, Dataset, or Image you want to share.

2. **Copy the Link:**
   - click at the icon.

### How the Shared Link Works
- When another user accesses the shared link, OMERO will prompt them for authentication.
- If the user has permission to view the data, they will gain access after successful authentication.
- If the user does not have the required permission, the data will not be visible, even if they have the link.

This ensures that only authorized users can view and interact with shared data within OMERO.
